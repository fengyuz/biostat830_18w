## Project 1: Phenotype Prediction
See `prediced_pheno/` for the prediction results.
To replicate the result, 
# Download the datasets from [ge_prediction](https://github.com/biosML/ge_prediction).
# Put all the training genotypes in `training_genotype/`, training phenotypes in `training_phenotype/`, and testing genotypes in `testing_genotype/`.
# Run `bash predict_all.sh`
